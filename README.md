## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to use responsive grid that adapts with `auto-fit` and uses `minmax()` for flexibility sizing. In media queries, it becomes a 6-column custom layout.

This is how I do it, see below:

```css
.features {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(auto, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}

@media (min-width: 52em) {
  .features {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 1fr);
  }

  .one {
    grid-column: 1 / span 2;
    grid-row: 2 / span 2;
  }

  .two {
    grid-column: 3 / span 2;
    grid-row: 1 / span 2;
  }

  .three {
    grid-column: 3 / span 2;
    grid-row: 3 / span 2;
  }

  .four {
    grid-column: 5 / span 2;
    grid-row: 2 / span 2;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

In this project right now I`m using grid column and row numbers, in the next project i want to start using named grid areas instead of numeric positioning, which makes the gridâ€™s structure easier to read and adjust.

### Useful resources

- [Guide to CSS Grid](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/) - This helped me understand about grid and and how used it and apply on this project. Its give clearer explanation with example by adding a small code snippet and a visual analogy.
